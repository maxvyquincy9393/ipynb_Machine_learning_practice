\# Learning math and ml





A practical machine learning and Python project focused on building solid fundamentals, clean experimentation, and reproducible results.



Overview



This repository contains a hands-on project developed as part of my learning journey toward becoming an AI Engineer.

The main goal of this project is to apply core concepts of Python, data processing, and machine learning into a structured and understandable workflow.



Rather than focusing on shortcuts or black-box solutions, this project emphasizes:



clarity of logic



correctness of implementation



understanding of underlying concepts



Key Features



Data loading and preprocessing



Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)



Machine learning model training



Model evaluation and basic comparison



Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step experimentation



Clean and readable code structure



Technologies Used

Category	Tools

Language	Python

Environment	Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab

Data Processing	NumPy, Pandas

Visualization	Matplotlib

Machine Learning	scikit-learn

Installation and Setup



Clone the repository



git clone https://github.com/maxvyquincy9393/REPO\_NAME.git





Navigate into the project directory



cd REPO\_NAME





Create and activate a virtual environment



python -m venv venv

venv\\Scripts\\activate   # Windows

source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux





Install dependencies



pip install -r requirements.txt



How to Run



Launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook



jupyter lab





Open the main notebook inside the notebooks/ folder



Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the results



Example Output



This project produces:



Data visualizations for analysis



Trained machine learning models



Evaluation metrics such as accuracy or error scores



All outputs are documented inside the notebook for transparency.



Learning Objectives



This project was built to strengthen understanding of:



Python programming fundamentals



Data manipulation workflows



Machine learning pipeline structure



Model evaluation concepts



Proper use of notebooks for experimentation



Future Improvements



Improve model performance with hyperparameter tuning



Add model comparison and cross-validation



Refactor logic into reusable Python modules



Deploy model as a simple API



Add automated tests
